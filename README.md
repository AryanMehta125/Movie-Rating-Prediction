# Movie-Rating-Prediction
This project is a machine learning-based application designed to predict movie ratings based on a wide range of features such as genre, cast, director, year, and more. It helps anticipate a movie's potential rating on platforms like IMDb or Rotten Tomatoes, offering valuable insights for viewers, producers, and investors.

### 🔍 Features
📊 Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares data for training.
🧠 Machine Learning Models: Implements and compares various regression models:
    Linear Regression
    Random Forest Regressor
🏆 Evaluation Metrics: Includes MAE, MSE, and R² for performance evaluation.
💾 Model Persistence: Save and reuse trained models easily.
💽 Frontend UI: Built with Streamlit for easy and interactive usage.

### 📂 Dataset
Uses publicly available datasets from sources such as:
IMDb
The Movie Database (TMDB)
Kaggle movie metadata datasets

### ⚒️ Tech Stack
Backend: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Frontend: Streamlit
Environment: Vs Code

### 🚀 How to Use
Clone the repo.
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Streamlit app: streamlit run app.py
Explore prediction via UI or test via script.

### 💡 Contributions Welcome!
The project currently uses Streamlit for the frontend.
React-based frontend contributions are highly appreciated! If you're a frontend developer and want to enhance the UI/UX, feel free to fork the repo and raise a PR.
Any major improvement that significantly impacts the usability or performance of the project will be reviewed and merged into the main branch if accepted.

### 📌 Future Plans
Integrate a REST API for broader frontend compatibility
Use NLP to analyze plot summaries and descriptions
Improve prediction accuracy with deep learning models
